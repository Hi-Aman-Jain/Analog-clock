# Analog-clock
I created a Clock which shows time with two moving hands which move in circular motion and the clock face is marked from 1 to 12.
Thid is completely responsive analog clock build with the help of HTML And CSS and JavaScript.

To use it in your computer, just copy the code and paste it in your system. Remember, afterward link the CSS and JS file in HTML if they are not linked well.

# Analog Clock

I have created an analog clock that displays the current time using two moving hands that rotate in a circular motion. The clock face is marked with numbers from 1 to 12, representing the hours.

This analog clock is fully responsive and has been built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Usage

To use the analog clock on your computer, follow these steps:

1. Copy the code provided.
2. Paste the code into your system.
3. Ensure that the CSS and JS files are properly linked to the HTML file. If they are not linked, make sure to include the appropriate `<link>` and `<script>` tags in your HTML file to reference the CSS and JS files.

Now, you can open the HTML file in your web browser to see the analog clock in action. The clock will display the current time, and the moving hands will rotate accordingly.

Feel free to customize the design, colors, or any other aspects of the clock to suit your preferences or integrate it into your projects.

Please note that this analog clock is designed for use in web browsers and may not function as expected if used in other environments.

Thank you for using the analog clock! Enjoy watching time pass in a classic and elegant way.
